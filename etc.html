Cubism - like rickshaw, time series charting but built for streaming data http://square.github.io/cubism/
glimpse.js - Only area and line charts time series charts right now, maybe grow into more http://racker.github.io/glimpse.js-website/

https://www.polychart.com/ - Website application that generates charts. Closed source. I also heard that the new version doesn't use D3 anymore. 
http://d3-generator.com/ - Generate a bar chart with CSV via a website
